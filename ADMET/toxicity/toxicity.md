## LD50

Acute toxicity LD50 measures the most conservative dose that can lead to lethal adverse effects. The higher the dose, the more lethal of a drug.

## hERG

Inhibition of the hERG (human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene) current causes QT interval prolongation and lead to life threatening arrhythmia. Inhibition of hERG is considered as precaution.
